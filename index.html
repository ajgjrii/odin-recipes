    <p>No matter how hard we try, it seems the world is out to get us. We wake up early, 
        we put on pants, we go out to work, we come home, and we go to sleep. Pretty standard
        stuff. Seems like everything should go our way, right?
    </p>
    <p><strong>WRONG.</strong></p>
    <p>It only seems that way, because we <em>think</em> it should be that way, but in reality,
    the universe has conspired against us. That's why the site on recipes for disaster was 
    created. It is time that we fight back against the tyranny of the universe.</p>
    <p>The universe will not be ready for what we have in store.</p>
