This is the first project I am completing in the Odin Project. I am not too concerned, as I have some experience in web design in high school, although that was all the way back in 2007 (we are currently in 2022). 

It has been interesting learning about the new standards to HTML5 which I did not learn about in my webdesign class, so I need to make sure I keep those in mind. 

Much of my learning thus far has been on navigation of the command line (I am using Ubuntu on a spare device I have here at home), and the real challenge for me is going to be the usage of Github throughout this project.
