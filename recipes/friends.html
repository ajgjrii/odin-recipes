    <h1>Tired of Not Having Friends? Fear Not, Read This!</h1>

    <p>Humans are social creatures. For better or for worse, we need people. 
        <em>"But I am strong, independent, capable, and people like my co-worker 
            who rarely wears pants and commits to nothing are a real drain! Why do I need 
            other people?"</em> you might be asking yourself. And to that, we say that it's 
            a fair question. A really good question actually. We are going to have to get 
            back to you on a response for that.
    </p>
    <p>Anyway, it's probably best to make friends to fulfill the "social creatures" statement
        from earlier. Luckily, we have talked to absolutely nobody about this, and we developed 
        this recipe which is sure to guarantee a friend count that's easily in the some number 
        greater than negative one. How do we know that it's going to work? Honestly, we were 
        kind of hoping you would tell us. Try this out and get back to us, ok? Thanks!
    </p>
    <h2>For this recipe, you will need:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Something to Say</li>
        <li>Random People</li>
        <li>Lack of Boundaries</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure you have your thing to say primed and ready. Rehearse that bad boy, 
            because strangers will not respect an unscripted response.</li>
        <li>Say your thing to that random person. If they seem to be responding
            positively, say another random thing. If you didn't rehearse for anything
            past this point, that's kind of on you. If they respond negatively, run away
            quickly, they might form into an unruly mob, which is why you need friends in the 
            first place: to battle a mob.</li>
        <li>If you find yourself unable to get friends with your statements, try replicating
            what you see in the picture. See how friendly they are? Sure fire way to get friends.</li>
        <li>Congrats on the new friends! Enjoy your time together, and be sure to battle other mobs 
            in your free time!
        </li>
    </ol>
